Congratulations! You've found the GitHub repository hosting the source code for my personal website. Feel free to explore and dive into the inner workings of the site! This project is a culmination of my current skills, along with past and ongoing projects, plus a glimpse of whatâ€™s in store for the future.

If something doesn't look quite right, I'd love to hear from you! Constructive feedback helps me grow, so feel free to shoot me an email with any suggestions or improvements.

This repository is actively maintained and updated as I make time to refine the site. Be sure to check back periodically to follow along with my progress behind the scenes!

Happy browsing!
